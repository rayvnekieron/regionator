## Visualizing and publishing large datasets with Region-based KML ##

Here is a wiki page presenting a use-case of "regionated" KML files: [Swiss Transit data](http://code.google.com/p/regionator/wiki/SwissTransit).

The source is available in the [ch-sbb directory](http://regionator.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ch-sbb/).
